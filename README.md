# render-hooks

## Motivation
By now I'm sure we're all deeply familiar with the infamous Rules of Hooks:

> Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. 

https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#only-call-hooks-at-the-top-level

Often, to adhere to these rules, we end up adding extra layers of indirection into our render function in the form of components whose sole purpose is to act as a container for hook calls. 

Consider the case of a simple Modal component that accepts a `close` function, where we would like to memoize the `close` function using `useCallback`.

We may want to write code that looks like this:

```js
const Example = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)
      
  return (
    <div>
      {isOpen ? 
        // This violates the rule of hooks on branching
        <Modal 
          close={React.useCallback(() => setIsOpen(false), [setIsOpen])}
        >
          Blah
        </Modal> : 
        null
      }
    </div>
  )
}
```

But due to the rule of hooks on branching, we're instead forced to write code that looks like this:

```js
const ModalWrapper = ({ setIsOpen }) => (
  <Modal 
    close={React.useCallback(() => setIsOpen(false), [setIsOpen])}
  >
    Blah
  </Modal>
)

const Example = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)
      
  return (
    <div>
      {isOpen ? 
        <ModalWrapper setIsOpen={setIsOpen} /> : 
        null
      }
    </div>
  )
}
```

So we're forced to add an extra layer of indirection to what used to be a simple, self-contained render function, in addition to being forced to write a bunch of boilerplate for creating the new component and drilling in all the necessary props (TypeScript users will feel double the pain here as they'd have to duplicate type declarations for the drilled-in props as well).

Some readers may point out that they _prefer_ the latter version to the earlier one, as they might feel encapsulating everything in that branch into a `ModalWrapper` component reduces noise and improves readability, i.e. that it's a _useful_ layer of indirection. 

That's a perfectly valid position to take, but I'd like to remind those readers that the decision on whether or not to add any layer of indirection should reflect a value judgement on whether or not we feel the indirection is actually useful (inherently subjective and should be made on case-by-case basis), not forced upon us by some arbitrary implementation detail of the library we're using.

This is where `render-hooks` comes in.

## Installation

```js
npm i @lewisl9029/render-hooks
```

or 

```
yarn add @lewisl9029/render-hooks
```

## Usage

```js
import * as React from 'react'
import Hooks from '@lewisl9029/render-hooks'

const Example = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)
      
  return (
    <div>
      {isOpen ? 
        // use hooks anywhere in the tree, without introducing another component
        <Hooks>
          {() => (
            <Modal 
              close={React.useCallback(() => setIsOpen(false), [setIsOpen])}
            >
              Blah
            </Modal>
          )}
        </Hooks> : 
        null
      }
    </div>
  )
}
```

The `Hooks` component from `render-hooks` acts as a component boundary for all of your hook calls. You can add it anywhere inside the render tree to call hooks in a way that would otherwise have violated the rules of hooks, without adding any additional layers of indirection.

Note that it also works great for looping:

```js
import * as React from 'react'
import Hooks from '@lewisl9029/render-hooks'

const Example = ({ colors }) => {
      
  return (
    <ul>
      {colors.map((color) => 
        <Hooks>
          {() => <li style={useMemo(() => ({ color }), [color])}>{color}</li>}
        </Hooks>
      )}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

However, keep in mind that you still have to obey the rules of hooks within the `Hooks` render function:

```js
import * as React from 'react'
import Hooks from '@lewisl9029/render-hooks'

const Example = ({ colors }) => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)
      
  return (
    <div>
      {isOpen ? 
        <Hooks>
          {() => (
            <Modal 
              close={React.useCallback(() => setIsOpen(false), [setIsOpen])}
            >
              <ul>
                {colors.map((color) => (
                  // This still violates the rule of hooks on looping
                  <li style={useMemo(() => ({ color }), [color])}>{color}</li>
                ))}
              </ul>
            </Modal>
          )}
        </Hooks> : 
        null
      }
    </div>
  )
}
```

We can, however, nest additional layers of the `Hooks` component to arbitrary depths to work around this (though the extra levels of indenting will make code impractical to read past a certain point):

```js
import * as React from 'react'
import Hooks from '@lewisl9029/render-hooks'

const Example = ({ colors }) => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)
      
  return (
    <div>
      {isOpen ? 
        <Hooks>
          {() => (
            <Modal 
              close={React.useCallback(() => setIsOpen(false), [setIsOpen])}
            >
              <ul>
                {colors.map((color) => 
                  // All good now
                  <Hooks>
                    {() => <li style={useMemo(() => ({ color }), [color])}>{color}</li>}
                  </Hooks>
                )}
              </ul>
            </Modal>
          )}
        </Hooks> : 
        null
      }
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now we can go back to adding indirection only when we feel it's useful, instead of being forced to every time we want to call a hook inside a branch or loop.

## Linting

If you're using [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks), you'll get errors when trying to use `render-hooks` due to the plugin not recognizing that `Hooks` can be treated as a valid component boundary.

I've created a fork of the plugin at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lewisl9029/render-hooks to add support for this pattern. The changes are [very naive](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/48932399adc47a3defc27f3edbbf5da92050d3d0) however, so I do anticipate plenty of edge cases. Please feel free to report any issues you find with the plugin here.

## How it works

The implementation is literally 1 line:

```js
export const Hooks = ({ children }) => children()
```

By packaging it as a library I'm mostly trying to promote the pattern and make it easier to get people started using it. Feel free to simply copy paste this into your project and use it directly, replacing the eslint plugin with my fork from above.
